# Specification for Template Engine Library

## Overview
This library is a sophisticated template engine designed to process templates by utilizing custom tags, such as `<set:if>` and `<set:for>`, to facilitate conditional rendering and iteration over collections, respectively. It converts template text into a series of segments—either strings for static parts or instances of classes derived from the `Set` class for dynamic parts—and renders the final HTML text by evaluating these segments against provided parameters.

## Components

### 1. Tag System
- The engine employs a variety of tags to implement logic within templates, facilitating dynamic content generation.
- Key tags include:
  - `<set:if condition="...">...</set:if>` for rendering content based on conditions.
  - `<set:for in="..." each="...">...</set:for>` for looping over elements in collections.
- These tags are processed and converted into corresponding class instances (`SetIf` for conditional rendering and `SetFor` for iteration) which are then evaluated to generate dynamic content.

### 2. Registration (`setfunc.js`)
- Functions and custom tags are registered through `setfunc.js`, enabling the template engine to recognize and process them accordingly.
- The registration mechanism supports the addition of custom logic and tags, enhancing the engine's flexibility and capability. It includes predefined classes such as `SetIf` and `SetFor` to handle conditional and iterative logic, as well as a base `Set` class for general dynamic content rendering.

### 3. Teardown Process (`template.js`)
- This process deconstructs the template text into segments, facilitating the separation of static and dynamic content.
- Segments are categorized as:
  - Plain strings for static template parts.
  - Instances of `Set` class or its subclasses like `SetIf`, `SetFor` for dynamic content, which are instantiated based on the tags identified in the template.
- The teardown involves parsing the template using regular expressions to identify tags, extracting their attributes and content, and organizing these into a structured format for further processing. This structured format includes nested segments for tags contained within other tags, allowing for complex template structures.

### 4. Setup Process (`template.js`)
- This phase is tasked with rendering the final HTML output.
- It operates on the segments produced by the teardown process, utilizing the provided parameters to evaluate dynamic content.
- The rendering mechanism involves:
  - Evaluating dynamic segments (e.g., conditions, loops) to generate content.
  - Merging both static and evaluated dynamic segments to assemble the complete HTML document.
- The evaluation of dynamic segments leverages the `render` method defined in the `Set` class and its subclasses, which recursively processes nested segments to produce the final output.
